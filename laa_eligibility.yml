    To Do: Consider Adding Line-Item support for income?
    To Do: Consider Adding Line-Item support for assets.
    To Do: Testing.
    To Do: Make it so that it doesn't switch back and forth between people and money.metadata:
    Need to see about getting commutative short circuiting in disjunctive clauses.
    See slack chat with Johnathan Pyle in DocAssemble June 7 2018.
    Deal better with questions that the user may not have the answer for.
    Figure out a way to deal with Duty Counsel services.
    Bug: it seems to be asking for residence alternatives for no reason. This may be
    a shortcutting problem.
    Determine whether the rule eliminates consideration of both merit and likelihood
    of success or just one of the two.
    Change alternative to residence for criminal matters in Alberta to use the matter type,
    delete the extra question.
    Deal with the kinds of representation that can be ordered by the court or requested
    by the Minister.
    Confirm that matrimonial property requirement of additional services is sub d not sub b.
    Deal with appeals of things as an option in the lists.
